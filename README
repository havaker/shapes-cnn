Before runnning any notebooks or *.py files, data/extracted must be filled
with *.png files and labels.csv. It can be accomplished by running
`bash scripts/extract.sh`.

Reports can be found in notebooks/ directory.

src/shapes.py:
- dataset implementation
- data augmentation

src/trainer.py:
- generic training/testing

src/classification.py
- classification network definition
- classification problem class

src/counting.py
- counting network definition (60 outputs)
- counting problem class

src/counting135.py
- counting135 network definition (135 outputs)
- counting135 problem class

Each problem class defines suitable loss function, optimizer, measures
accuracy and is responsible for creating trainer instance.
It also handles things specific to a problem, eg. confusion matrix generation.

src/main.py
- console interface
- provides a way to save/load models from a filesystem
